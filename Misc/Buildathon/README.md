##  Welcome to the Buildathon

We encourage you to focus on the Azure Machine Learning and Stream Analytics aspects.  Please in your buildathon projects pick from one below and keep your scope simple at first, then build to more complex.  Some of these suggestions have a Microsoft R Server version.

__Your verticals to choose from:__
* Manufacturing
  - **Predictive maintenance for aircraft engines** [here](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Solution/Predictive-Maintenance-for-Aerospace-1).  
    * Task:  modify to another manufacturing sector.  
    * Challenges:  Modifying the synthetic data generator downloadable on the solution page under `"Next Steps"` to represent your dataset.  We will help with this if need be.
  - **Energy Demand Forecasting - you are very familiar with this**
    * Task:  modify for another manufacturing or utlity related scenario.
    * Challenges:  Adding a Web Job to gather the appropriate data
  - *Both* of the above have Microsoft R Server (in fact, **SQL Server R Services** which leverages MRS from within SQL Server 2016) versions for which you can deploy.  Learn more here:
    * Both Predictive maintenance and Energy demand forecasting have sapmles here:  https://github.com/Microsoft/SQL-Server-R-Services-Samples
