IoT Struggles Story


Every day, Intelligent Mechatronic Systems Inc. collects 1.6 billion data points from hundreds of thousands of automobiles in the U.S. and Canada. The cars are equipped with devices that track driving distance, acceleration, fuel use and other information on how the vehicles are being operated -- data that IMS uses to support usage-based insurance programs and fleet and traffic management initiatives. Until the middle of this year, the data was stored in a MariaDB relational database, but the open source software imposed rigid limits on how the data could be structured, which complicated efforts to analyze it.


"We knew there was inherent value in the data," said Christopher Dell, senior director of product development and management at Intelligent Mechatronic Systems (IMS). "We just didn't know how to unlock that value."

So in August 2015, after a yearlong project, IMS added an Apache Cassandra NoSQL database along with data integration and analytics tools from Pentaho. Now, data flows through the MariaDB system into Cassandra, giving the Waterloo, Ontario, company's data scientists more flexibility in formatting the information. That setup lets the analytics team perform finer-grained analysis of customer driving behavior in search of patterns and trends that could help insurers fine-tune their usage-based policies and rates.

In addition, Dell said the new technologies should allow IMS to better handle future data growth, which is expected to be generated by two developments. The company hopes a newer smartphone app for collecting vehicle data will make its subscriber base "skyrocket." There's also an ongoing move to combine driving information with other types of data from the Internet of Things (IoT), such as weather records and telematics captured by so-called smart home systems.
