# IoT on Azure Training Course Materials
Here, we provide training materials for a course covering a solution around IoT on Azure.

## CIS Components Covered

**Data Source and Ingestion**

1.  [Start with your raw streaming data]
1.  *Azure Event Hub* - receives the data from a raw data input stream
3. *Azure Storage* - archives the raw streaming data for future processing

**Data Preparation and Analysis**

2.  *Azure Stream Analytics* - provides near real-time analytics and publishes results to Power BI dashboard, as well as, shuttles raw data to Azure Storage for archiving
3.  *HD Insights* - provides a method for custom data aggregation by running Hive scripts on raw events archived by Azure Stream Analytics service
4. *Azure Data Factory* - orchestrates data flow, running Hive scripts, calling out to the Azure Machine Learning service, and management of Azure SQL Database service
5. *Azure Machine Learning* - returns predictions (here, future power consumption forecasts) based on inputs received

**Data Publishing and Consumption**

6.  *Azure SQL Database* - stores the results of the Azure Machine Learning service
7.  *Power BI* - dashboarding service containing aggregations provided by Azure Stream Analytics (data in motion) and Azure Machine Learning service results stored in Azure SQL Database (data at rest).
