##  Welcome to the Buildathon

Your challenge is to modify and tinker with an existing solution template of interest from the ones recommended below,  We encourage you to focus on the Azure Machine Learning and Stream Analytics aspects or Azure Data Factory given expertise.  Please, in your buildathon projects pick from one below and keep your scope simple at first, then build to more complex.  Some of these suggestions have a Microsoft R Server version as well.

__Your verticals to choose from:__

* Manufacturing
  - **Predictive maintenance for aircraft engines (Legacy solution)** at https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Solution/Predictive-Maintenance-for-Aerospace-1 with separate data generator
    -  Task:  modify to another manufacturing sector
    -  Challenges:  modifying the synthetic data generator downloadable on the solution page under `"Next Steps"` to represent your dataset.  It is a .NET Visual Studio project and should not be too hard to modify.
  - **Predictive maintenance for aircraft engines (Cortana Intelligence Quick Starts solution)** at https://start.cortanaintelligence.com/Legacy/#gallery/predictivemaintenance
    -  Task:  modify for another manufacturing related scenario.
    -  Challenges:  Adding a Web Job to gather the appropriate data 
  - **Energy Demand Forecasting - you are very familiar with this**
    -  Task:  modify for another demand forecasting or utlity related scenario.
    -  Challenges:  Adding a Web Job to gather the appropriate data
  - *Both* of the above have Microsoft R Server (in fact, **SQL Server R Services** which leverages MRS from within SQL Server 2016) versions for which you can deploy.  Learn more here:
    - Both Predictive maintenance and Energy demand forecasting have sapmles here:  https://github.com/Microsoft/SQL-Server-R-Services-Samples
    - Challenges:  learning curve for MRS and SQL Server built-in stored procedures to work with MRS
