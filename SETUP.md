## Pre-Requisites for All

1.  Azure account linked to a Microsoft Account, e.g. <yourname>@outlook.com or your work email, (it's recommended it be your **organizational/work email**) - please follow the instructions [here](PASS_SETUP.md) to set up an Azure Pass using the code assigned to you after registration AND the proper email (this is applicable if you are taking this course in an instructor-led format).  The best email will be your organizational email, but you can also use a Microsoft Account.

2.  Power BI online account - Power BI online requires an **organizational/work email** (sign-in or sign-up [here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/landing/signin/)).  If you only have a Microsoft Account (not organizational/work related), it is recommended you get a trial Office 365 account [here]() and sign up for Power BI online with that.

3.  Visual Studio 2015 Desktop (Community Edition is fine) - Please ensure you install with:
  * SQL Server Data Tools or download separately [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt204009.aspx).
