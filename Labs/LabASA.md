Instructions:
* Follow along to get to the Query in the classic portal (manage.azure.com)
* Save the original query somewhere for later
* Modify the query to use a hopping window for the aggregation of Load which is the energy load (let’s aggregate by the SUM).  Then, check your answer in the “Code” folder within the ASA_Query_Hopping.sql file or at https://github.com/michhar/data-pipeline-education/blob/master/Code/ASA_Query_Hopping.sql.  You may want to test here (which is why we are using the classic portal for the editing)

Note:  Later we will change this back to the original query before the PBI section.

In case you finish early, take a look at:
