##  Deploying the Energy Demand Forecasting Template

After, you have ensured your Azure account has the Azure credits given in the Passes for the instructor-led format or enough for 4 days of use (Standard tiers for:  App Services, Streaming Analytics, Event Hubs, SQL DB, Data Factory, SQL Server) AND that you have been "whitelisted" (instructions found [here](PREREQUISITES.md)) plesae do the following:

1.  Make sure you can access https://start.cortanaintelligence.com.  When there, ensure that you can:
  * Navigate to "DEPLOYMENTS"
  * Click on "+New" button in upper right corner
  * See the small "More" link at the bottom left
  * After clicking on "More", ensure you can see the "Energy Demand Forecasting" solution template card (about 1/2 of the way down the page)<br>

2.  Give your solution a good name (e.g. `octenergymh`) - this will be the prefix of your resources and the name of your resource group.<br>

3.  Give your SQL database admin user a name and password (write these down now to remember them).  Now you may click "Deploy" to deploy the entire solution template.<br>

4.  An architecture diagram will pop up with the status of the resources.  This provisioning step may take up to 20 minutes.<br>

5.  Congratulations, you now have a solution template deployed!  We will be using this for the duration of the training.  A set of instructions will come up after everything is provisioned with more information and links for the resources.  Feel free to read through these.
